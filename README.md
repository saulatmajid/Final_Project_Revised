Student Progress Tracking System
---------------------------------

Welcome to my Final Project repo. This program has been designed to help a teacher retrieve her students' scores from a data file.
I have included some steps to help you use this program. Firstly, please download the following files in any seperate folder or on your desktop:

- final_project.py
- SchoolData.csv
- grade.py
- project_exception.py
- section.py
- student.py
- subject.py
- test.py 

1. Open the final_project.py and run it, a menu with 5 options will appear 

2. Select from the menu and type your chosen number, follow the prompts on the screen

3. Options 1 and 2 will ask for a name, type any name and the program will offer the available choices to the user. Also be warned that in case of a wrong name, the program will take you back to the beginning of Step3. Choose again, and,  this time, as you type the correct name from the given choices, the program asks you the next question, and finally dispalys the scores for you. 

4. Do try all the 5 choices to check how the program works.

5. Your feedback and comments will be valued.


Thanks!!
